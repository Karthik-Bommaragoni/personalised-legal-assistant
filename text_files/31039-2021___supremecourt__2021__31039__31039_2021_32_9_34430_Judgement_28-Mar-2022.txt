1 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO.1816 OF 2022 M/s. IMPERIA STRUCTURE LTD. Appellant VERSUS BRIG. HARIT PANT Respondent O R D E R This appeal arises out of the judgment and order dated 11.10.2021 passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi ( the National Commission  for short) in Consumer Case No.1043 of 2018. The National Commission in paragraph 10 of its judgment relied upon the decision of this Court in Imperia Structures Ltd. v. Anil Patni & Another, (2020) 10 SCC 783. Paragraph 25 of the decision in Imperia Structures Ltd. (supra) was as under:  25. In terms of Section 18 of the RERA Act, if a promoter fails to complete or is unable to give possession of an apartment duly completed by the date specified in the agreement, the promoter would be liable, on demand, to return the amount received by him in respect of that apartment if the allottee wishes to withdraw from the Project. Such right of an allottee is specifically made  without prejudice to any other remedy available to him . The right so given to the allottee is unqualified and if availed, the money deposited by the allottee has to be refunded Digitally signed by Dr. Mukesh Nasa Date: 2022.04.01 16:01:33 IST Reason: Signature Not Verified 2 with interest at such rate as may be prescribed. The proviso to Section 18(1) contemplates a situation where the allottee does not intend to withdraw from the Project. In that case he is entitled to and must be paid interest for every month of delay till the handing over of the possession. It is up to the allottee to proceed either under Section 18(1) or under proviso to Section 18(1). The case of Himanshu Giri came under the latter category. The RERA Act thus definitely provides a remedy to an allottee who wishes to withdraw from the Project or claim return on his investment.  Since the National Commission has followed the decision of this Court in Imperia Structures Ltd. (supra), we see no reason to entertain this appeal. The Civil Appeal is, accordingly, dismissed. No costs.  .J. (UDAY UMESH LALIT)  .J. (S. RAVINDRA BHAT)  .J.
